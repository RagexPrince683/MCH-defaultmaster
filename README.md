default mcheli SRC, idc sue me

Mcheli SRC, personally I set it up using intellij.

you need jdk-8u361-windows
and if your on 64x 64x 32 for 32.

you may need to run setupdecompworkspace , not sure given I already ran with this project so I have no idea.

open gradle console you should see gradle and then a bunch of things, then you want to type 

build

then if all goes well go to build/libs and a java file will be there. If you have made edits to the src you want to open the jar file with a archiver tool such as winrar. You can put this compiled class code into mcheli/mcheli of a actual mcheli instance and test things out yourself.
